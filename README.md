The purpose of this project was to perform EDA on Netflix and to see if I could recommend Netflix to others.

Questions:

1 : Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies (Ratio of movies to TV Serials).

2 : Understanding what content is available in different countries.

3 : Understanding which countries have most content released and yearly analysis.

4 : TV-Shows with maximum seasons.   

5 : What is the maximum duration of movies in Netflix ?


Conclusion: 

I could conclude from my analysis that netflix provides more movie content compared to TV Series
Also, the maximum amount of content was released in USA followed by India and others.
Another interesting finding was that the maximum amount of genre available in movies was DRAMA and in Tv Series was International TV Series. 
Netflix had maximum amount of content released in year 2019 which is pre Pandemic. It dropped in 2020 my hypothesis is that maybe pandemic affected Netflix as well.
